<h1>Happiness-Project</h1>
<hr>
<p>This project creates a website interface in which the user can explore happiness levels in different countries, years, and regressed against country demographics. Our dataset came from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mathurinache/world-happiness-report-20152021">Kaggle Gallup World Happiness Report 2015-2021</a>. We wanted to visualize the happiness data so that the user might see more easily trends and possible explanations as to why some countries might be happier than others. Our interface allows the user to explore on their own without any inferences.
